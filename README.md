firefox-aria2-integration
========================

aria2 integration extension for Mozilla Firefox

This add-on is based on [`chrome-aria2-integration` by roooneey](https://github.com/roooneey/chrome-aria2-integration) and forked to work for the latest Mozilla Firefox "Quantum".

Since Mozilla Firefox doesn't support javascript API `chrome.downloads.onDeterminingFilename`, which in the source code has been replaced to `chrome.downloads.onCreated` as workaround.
